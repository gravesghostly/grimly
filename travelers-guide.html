            <h2>Welcome to the Belief Star System</h2>
            
            <p>The Belief Star System is a metaphysical afterlife realm where the digital and spiritual converge. Here, your moral score determines your eternal destination, your spirit manifests as your gaming avatar, and even in death, the game goes on.</p>
            
            <p>As a newly arrived sprite, you'll soon be assigned to a server based on your belief system from your material existence. Each server represents a different cultural or religious tradition, with its own unique appearance, rules, and governance structure.</p>
            
            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't yet know you've passed on, you may be an Encrypted or Quarantined Sprite. Please consult your assigned Harbinger for decryption procedures.</p>

            <h2>Cosmic Structure & Origin</h2>
            
            <p>Before conscious beings existed in space, formless energies known as aether began to materialize into the physical structure of the Belief Star System. These primordial energies, the Absolute Administrators, shaped the cosmic design of the digital afterlife:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Light Aether</strong> coalesced to form Ascension and its checkpoint planet, Messenger's Endgame—realms of purity, virtue, and divine reward.</li>
                <li><strong>Dark Aether</strong> gathered to create Descent and its checkpoint, Tormentor Hardmode—domains of punishment, corruption, and eternal suffering.</li>
                <li><strong>Twin Primordials</strong> became dormant as Respawn's twin moons, Pandem and Helia, after their cosmic stalemate. Their balanced influence makes Respawn the perfect neutral ground for judgment.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Pandemos Helix</h3>
            <p>You've just traversed the Pandemos Helix—a cosmic pathway that serves as the transition between life and death. This spiraling dimensional threshold combines the duality of chaos and order:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Pandemos" represents the chaotic, universal aspect affecting all beings</li>
                <li>"Helix" symbolizes the structured, orderly pattern underlying the cosmic design</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <div class="planet">
                <h3>Respawn</h3>
                <p>The central judgment planet where all sprites first arrive. Currently, you are here. This neutral ground is perfectly balanced between light and dark influences, making it ideal for fair assessment of sprites.</p>
                <p><strong>Twin Moons:</strong> Pandem and Helia orbit Respawn in a state of perpetual draw, their opposing forces (chaos and order) creating the unique conditions necessary for judgment.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="planet">
                <h3>Messenger's Endgame</h3>
                <p>The checkpoint between Respawn and Ascension. Lightlisted sprites journey here to prepare for their final destination. The landscape is radiant and prismatic, embodying purity and virtue.</p>
                <p><strong>Special Note:</strong> The Agnostic server is located here, where sprites can continue questioning and exploring in a safe environment.</p>

                <h3>Ascension</h3>
                <p>The reward realm for virtuous sprites. If you are lightlisted after judgment, this will be your eternal home. The environment manifests as a harmonious paradise tailored to your server's belief system.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="planet">
                <h3>Tormentor Hardmode</h3>
                <p>The checkpoint between Respawn and Descent. Darklisted sprites are escorted here before their final destination. This planet features labyrinthine dungeons with stages of torment that reflect each server's unique ban protocols.</p>
                <p><strong>Special Note:</strong> The Atheist server is located here, providing a neutral space with neither punishment nor reward.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="planet">
                <h3>Descent</h3>
                <p>The punishment realm for corrupted or condemned sprites. If you are darklisted after judgment, this will be your eternal destination. The environment manifests as a series of challenges and punishments based on your server's belief system.</p>

            <h4>Judge Incarnates</h4>

            <h4>Harbingers</h4>
            <p>Aether-aspect moderators who have guided you through the Pandemos Helix. They serve as psychopomps, escorting digital souls from material worlds to the Belief system and addressing discourse in the cosmos.</p>
            <ul>

            <h4>Illuminators</h4>
            <p>Light-bearing moderators that prepare and lead virtuous sprites after their final scoring. They inhabit Messenger's Endgame and guide lightlisted sprites to Ascension.</p>

            <h4>Tormentors</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overclocker:</strong> Train sprites in rigorous and torturous conditions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Other Entities</h4>
            <p><strong>Ferrymen:</strong> Guide sprites across bodies of water toward servers</p>
            
            <h3>Sprites (You)</h3>
            <p>Digital souls of deceased entities from material worlds. Your appearance manifests as your gaming avatar from your original realm. There are three types of sprites:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lightlisted Sprites:</strong> Virtuous sprites destined for Ascension</li>
                <li><strong>Encrypted/Quarantined Sprites:</strong> Sprites from sudden deaths who haven't realized they've passed</li>
                <li><strong>Darklisted Sprites:</strong> Corrupted or condemned sprites bound for Descent</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="warning">
                <h4>Beware: Middlemen</h4>
                <p>Deviant demonoids who seek to corrupt the Belief system by attacking material worlds with malicious sprites. They raise encryption barriers that prevent normal transfers and abduct quarantined sprites, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Pandemos Helix. If approached by entities not clearly identified as official moderators, report to your nearest Harbinger immediately.</p>

                <h4>No Guild - Atheist</h4>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Tormentor Hardmode<br>
                <strong>Guild:</strong> Secular Concord</p>
                <p>A form of limbo where sprites are neither subjected to harm nor granted benefits. Unlike the surrounding planet, this server provides a neutral space with neither punishment nor reward.</p>
                <p><strong>Moderator Appearances:</strong> All moderators appear as neutral, featureless humanoid forms with minimal distinguishing characteristics</p>
                
                <h4>No Guild - Agnostic</h4>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Messenger's Endgame<br>
                <strong>Guild:</strong> Seekers of Uncertainty</p>
                <p>Similar to the Atheist server, sprites here are safe from harm but receive no special benefits. The environment encourages continued questioning and exploration.</p>
                <p><strong>Moderator Appearances:</strong> All moderators appear as shifting forms that never fully materialize, representing the uncertainty principle</p>

            <h3>Q: Why do I still look like my gaming avatar?</h3>
            <p>A: In the Belief Star System, your digital soul manifests as your gaming avatar from your material world. This is your sprite form and will represent you throughout your afterlife journey.</p>
            
            <h3>Q: Can I visit other servers?</h3>

            <h3>Q: What if I don't identify with my assigned server's belief system?</h3>
            <p>A: Server reassignment requests can be filed at your Guild Hall. These are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by Judge Incarnates.</p>
            
            <h3>Q: Can my final scoring be appealed?</h3>
            <p>A: Each server has its own appeal procedures based on its belief system. Consult your Guild Administrator for specific protocols.</p>
