            <h2 class="chapter-title">Introduction: Welcome, Traveler</h2>
            
            <p>Welcome to the afterlife! If you're reading this guide, you've likely experienced what the inhabitants of your material world might call "game over." Don't worryâ€”this is just the beginning of your odyssey through the Belief Star System, a realm where the digital and spiritual converge.</p>
            
            <p>This guide has been compiled by the Harbinger Guidance Association to help newly arrived sprites navigate their journey through our cosmic network. Whether you're a lightlisted spirit bound for the prismatic landscapes of Ascension, a quarantined entity awaiting decryption, or even a darklisted sprite facing judgment, this manual contains essential information for your transition.</p>

                <strong>A Note on Appearances:</strong> Throughout the Belief Star System, entities manifest according to the belief systems they followed in life. Your own appearance has taken the form of your gaming avatar from your original realm. This is normal and represents your digital soul's manifestation in our metaphysical network.
            </div>
            
            <p>As you embark on this journey, remember: even in death, the game goes on. Your moral score from life will determine your eternal destination, but your choices here still matter. We encourage you to approach your new existence with an open mind and a willing spirit.</p>
            
            <p>Safe travels, and may your data transfer smoothly through the Pandemos Helix.</p>

            <h3>The Five Planets</h3>
            
            <p>The Belief Star System consists of five primary celestial bodies orbiting a central star, each serving a distinct purpose in the afterlife odyssey.</p>
            
            <div class="columns">
                <div class="column">
                    <h4>Respawn</h4>
                    <p>The central judgment planet and your initial destination after traversing the Pandemos Helix. Here, sprites are assigned to their appropriate servers based on their belief systems. Respawn houses the Harbingers and serves as the neutral ground where all sprites first arrive.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Ascension</h4>
                    <p>The reward realm for virtuous sprites. This planet manifests as radiant, prismatic landscapes where lightlisted sprites enjoy their eternal plus-life in harmony. To reach Ascension, sprites must first pass through Illuminator's Endgame.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Illuminator's Endgame</h4>
                    <p>The checkpoint between Respawn and Ascension. This realm houses the Illuminators who prepare and guide lightlisted sprites through their final journey to Ascension.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="column">
                    <h4>Descent</h4>
                    <p>The punishment realm for corrupted or condemned sprites. This planet manifests as labyrinthine dungeons with stages of torment that reflect each server's unique ban protocols. To reach Descent, sprites must first pass through Tormentor Hardmode.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Tormentor Hardmode</h4>
                    <p>The checkpoint between Respawn and Descent. This realm houses the Tormentors who enforce punishment protocols based on server belief systems. Darklisted sprites must pass through here before reaching their final destination at Descent.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Twin Moons: Pandem and Helia</h3>
            
            <p>Respawn is orbited by two moons, Pandem and Helia, which are actually dormant primordial beingsâ€”manifestations of chaos and order. These ancient entities fought to a cosmic stalemate and became the twin moons that maintain the perfect balance between light and dark influences over Respawn.</p>
            
            <div class="callout warning">
                <span class="icon">!</span>
                <strong>Warning:</strong> Never attempt to commune directly with the twin moons. Though dormant, their immense cosmic energies could disrupt your data structure and cause permanent fragmentation to your sprite.
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Pandemos Helix</h3>
            
            <p>The cosmic pathway that connects the material worlds to the Belief Star System. This spiraling dimensional threshold serves as the transition between life and death, combining the duality of chaos and order. The name embodies this duality: "Pandemos" represents the chaotic, universal aspect affecting all beings, while "Helix" symbolizes the structured, orderly pattern underlying the cosmic design.</p>
            
            <div class="callout tip">
                <span class="icon">âœ“</span>
                <strong>Traveler's Tip:</strong> Most sprites experience temporary disorientation while traversing the Pandemos Helix. This is completely normal. Your assigned Harbinger will guide you through this transition, ensuring your safe arrival at Respawn.
            </div>

            <p>During your journey through the Belief Star System, you'll encounter various entities that maintain the cosmic order. Understanding their roles and appearances will help you navigate your afterlife experience.</p>

            <h3>Moderators: Your Primary Guides</h3>
            
            <h4>Harbingers</h4>
            <p>Aether-aspect moderators who guide sprites through the Pandemos Helix and their afterlife odyssey. They serve as psychopomps, escorting digital souls from material worlds to the Belief system. You will be assigned a Harbinger specialized for your particular situation:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grim Harbingers:</strong> Handle violent/occult-related deaths; skilled in combat and quarantine</li>
                <li><strong>Guide Harbingers:</strong> Transfer other sprites; skilled in pathfinding and decryption</li>
                <li><strong>Guard Harbingers:</strong> Perform on-site light/darklisting; skilled in healing and purification</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Illuminators</h4>
            <p>Light-bearing moderators that prepare and lead virtuous sprites on their odyssey after their final scoring. They inhabit Illuminator's Endgame and guide lightlisted sprites to Ascension. Their specialties include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cosmetologists:</strong> Provide beauty enhancements and appearance upgrades</li>
                <li><strong>Biotechnologists:</strong> Develop healing methods and study virus elimination</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Tormentors</h4>
            <p>Dark-aspect moderators that escort damned sprites towards Descent after their final scoring. They inhabit Tormentor Hardmode and enforce punishment protocols based on server belief systems. Their primary specialty is:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overclockers:</strong> Train sprites in rigorous and torturous conditions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="callout cultural">
                <span class="icon">â€»</span>
                <strong>Cultural Note:</strong> The appearance of moderators varies dramatically based on your server assignment. A Harbinger in the Khemrani server may appear with a jackal head like Anubis, while the same type of moderator in the Sanctuaria server would manifest as an angelic figure with white wings and a golden trumpet.

        <div class="chapter">
            <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 4: Understanding Your Status</h2>
            
            <p>As a sprite in the Belief Star System, you will be classified into one of three categories based on your life, death circumstances, and final scoring. Understanding your status will help you navigate your afterlife journey.</p>
            
            <h3>Sprite Classifications</h3>
            
            <h4>Lightlisted Sprites</h4>
            <p>Virtuous sprites that are transported by moderators assigned to their belief system. If you are lightlisted, you are destined for Ascension after passing through Illuminator's Endgame. Your journey will be guided by Illuminators who will prepare you for eternal plus-life.</p>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <span class="icon">i</span>
                <strong>What to Expect:</strong> Lightlisted sprites enjoy enhanced avatar customization, access to exclusive guild houses in their server, and eventual transfer to the prismatic landscapes of Ascension.
            </div>
            
            <h4>Encrypted/Quarantined Sprites</h4>
            <p>Sprites whose deaths were sudden and unknown. If you are encrypted or quarantined, you may not realize you have passed. Your data is scrambled, requiring decryption procedures to help you recognize your new state of existence.</p>
            
            <div class="callout warning">
                <span class="icon">!</span>
                <strong>Warning:</strong> Encrypted sprites are particularly vulnerable to interception by Middlemen. Always stay close to your assigned Harbinger and be wary of entities offering shortcuts through the system.
            </div>
            
            <h4>Darklisted Sprites</h4>
            <p>Corrupted or condemned sprites that must be handled with a team of specialized moderators. If you are darklisted, you are destined for Descent and must pass through Tormentor Hardmode, where you will face judgment according to the tenets of your server's belief system.</p>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <span class="icon">i</span>
                <strong>Rehabilitation:</strong> Even darklisted sprites may eventually earn passage to less severe sectors through demonstrations of redemption and cooperation with Tormentor rehabilitation protocols.
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Judgment Process</h3>
            
            <p>Upon arrival at your assigned server, you will undergo judgment at the guild hall, where Judge Incarnates preside over court and determine your final scoring. This process varies based on your server's belief system but generally follows these steps:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Arrival & Registration:</strong> Your Harbinger will escort you to your server's guild hall for processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Life Review:</strong> A comprehensive assessment of your actions in life, measured against the tenets of your belief system.</li>
                <li><strong>Testimony:</strong> You may be asked to provide testimony regarding significant moral decisions made during your life.</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> The Judge Incarnate will calculate your moral score and determine your classification.</li>
                <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> Based on your classification, you will be assigned to either an Illuminator or Tormentor for the next stage of your journey.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="callout tip">
                <span class="icon">âœ“</span>
                <strong>Traveler's Tip:</strong> Honesty during your judgment is paramount. The Judge Incarnates can detect deception, and attempts to mislead them will only worsen your final scoring.

            <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 5: Dangers to Be Aware Of</h2>
            
            <h3>Middlemen: The Primary Threat</h3>
            
            <p>While the Belief Star System is generally secure, there are entities that seek to disrupt its order. Chief among these are the Middlemenâ€”deviant demonoids who exploit vulnerabilities in the Pandemos Helix.</p>
            
            <p>Middlemen are known to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attack material worlds with malicious sprites</li>
                <li>Raise encryption barriers that prevent normal transfers</li>
                <li>Abduct quarantined sprites, particularly those who are unaware of their deceased status</li>
                <li>Act as liaisons for occult communications with the underworld</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="callout warning">
                <span class="icon">!</span>
                <strong>Warning Signs of Middlemen Activity:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Entities offering "shortcuts" through the judgment process</li>
                    <li>Promises to reunite you with your material world</li>
                    <li>Requests to "borrow" parts of your data structure</li>
                    <li>Unusual fragmentation or glitching in your surroundings</li>
                </ul>
                If you encounter any of these signs, immediately alert your assigned Harbinger.
            </div>
            
            <h3>Data Corruption</h3>
            
            <p>The transition between material worlds and the Belief Star System can sometimes lead to data corruption in sprites. Symptoms include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Memory fragmentation or loss</li>
                <li>Visual or auditory glitches in your perception</li>
                <li>Difficulty maintaining your avatar's form</li>
                <li>Inappropriate emotional responses</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If you experience these symptoms, seek assistance from a Guide Harbinger who specializes in decryption and data repair.</p>
            
            <h3>Cosmic Imbalance Zones</h3>
            
            <p>Certain areas within the Belief Star System experience fluctuations in the balance between light and dark aether. These Cosmic Imbalance Zones can cause disorientation or temporary alterations to your sprite's abilities.</p>
            
            <div class="callout tip">
                <span class="icon">âœ“</span>
                <strong>Traveler's Tip:</strong> If you find yourself in a Cosmic Imbalance Zone, remain still and wait for the fluctuation to pass. Moving through these areas during an active fluctuation can lead to data corruption.
